## Installation

You can get the stable version for the original version of the API from CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("patentsview")
```

Or the development version from GitHub (*Currently broken*):

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!"devtools" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

devtools::install_github("ropensci/patentsview")
```

Or the R package for the new version of the API from r-universe:

```{r eval = FALSE}
options(repos = c(
  patentsview = "https://mustberuss.r-universe.dev/",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))

install.packages("patentsview")
```
## Important API Change

The new version of the API requires an API key, or all of your requests will be blocked.  An API key can be obtained [here](https://patentsview.org/apis/keyrequest).  The updated R package will look for an environmental variable PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY set to the value of your key. For windows it would be
```
set PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY=my_keys_value_without quotes
```

See [this page](articles/api-changes.html) about the change. The navigation above will get you to the updated vignettes and reference pages.

## Basic usage

The [PatentsView API](https://patentsview.org/apis/api-endpoints) provides an interface to a disambiguated version of USPTO. The `patentsview` R package provides one main function, `search_pv()`, to make it easy to interact with the API:

```{r}
library(patentsview)

search_pv(query = '{"_gte":{"patent_date":"2007-01-01"}}')
```

## Learning more

Head over to the package's [webpage](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/index.html) for more info, including:

* A [getting started vignette](articles/getting-started.html) for first-time users. 
* An in-depth tutorial on [writing queries](articles/writing-queries.html)
* A list of [basic examples](articles/examples.html)
* Two examples of data applications (e.g., a brief analysis of the [top assignees](articles/top-assignees.html) in the field of databases)

This package was first introduced in 2017 in an [rOpenSci blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/09/19/patentsview/) which
used the original version of the API.  The same content, reworked to use the new version 
of the API, is available [here](articles/ropensci_blog_post.html).  A draft of a possible Tech Note 
about the new version of the API and R package is [here]().
