## Installation

You can get the stable version from CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("patentsview")
```

### Development version

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you can install the development version from GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ropensci/patentsview")
```

## Basic usage

The [PatentsView API](<https://search.patentsview.org/docs/docs/Search%20API/SearchAPIReference/>) provides an interface to a disambiguated version of USPTO. The `patentsview` R package provides one main function, `search_pv()`, to make it easy to interact with the API:

```{r}
library(patentsview)

search_pv(query = '{"_gte":{"patent_date":"2007-01-01"}}')
```

## Learning more

Head over to the package's [webpage](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/index.html) for more info, including:

* A [getting started vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/articles/getting-started.html) for first-time users. The package was also introduced in an [rOpenSci blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/09/19/patentsview/).
* An in-depth tutorial on [writing queries](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/articles/writing-queries.html)
* A list of [basic examples](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/articles/examples.html)
* Two examples of data applications (e.g., a brief analysis of the [top assignees](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/articles/top-assignees.html) in the field of databases)
