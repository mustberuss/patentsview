## Installation

You can get the stable version from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("patentsview")
```

### Development version

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you

pak::pak("ropensci/patentsview")
```

## Basic usage

The [PatentsView API](https://patentsview.org/apis/api-endpoints)
provides an interface to a disambiguated version of USPTO. The
`patentsview` R package provides one main function, `search_pv()`, to
make it easy to interact with the API:

``` r
library(patentsview)

search_pv(query = '{"_gte":{"patent_date":"2007-01-01"}}')
#> $data
#> #### A list with a single data frame on patents level:
#> 
#> List of 1
#>  $ patents:'data.frame': 1000 obs. of  1 variable:
#>   ..$ patent_id: chr [1:1000] "10000000" ...
#> 
#> $query_results
#> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
#> 
#> total_hits = 5,815,634
```
