## Installation

You can get the stable version for the original version of the API from
CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("patentsview")
```

Or the development version from GitHub (*Currently broken*):

``` r
if (!"devtools" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

devtools::install_github("ropensci/patentsview")
```

Or the R package for the new version of the API from r-universe:

``` r
options(repos = c(
  patentsview = "https://mustberuss.r-universe.dev/",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))

install.packages("patentsview")
```

## Important API Change

The new version of the API requires an API key, or all of your requests
will be blocked. An API key can be obtained
[here](https://patentsview.org/apis/keyrequest). The updated R package
will look for an environmental variable PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY set to the
value of your key. For windows it would be

    set PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY=my_keys_value_without quotes

See [this
page](https://mustberuss.github.io/patentsview/articles/api-changes.html)
about the change. The navigation there will get you to the updated
vignettes and reference pages.

## Basic usage

The [PatentsView API](https://patentsview.org/apis/api-endpoints)
provides an interface to a disambiguated version of USPTO. The
`patentsview` R package provides one main function, `search_pv()`, to
make it easy to interact with the API:

``` r
library(patentsview)

search_pv(query = '{"_gte":{"patent_date":"2007-01-01"}}')
#> $data
#> #### A list with a single data frame on patents level:
#> 
#> List of 1
#>  $ patents:'data.frame': 1000 obs. of  3 variables:
#>   ..$ patent_id   : chr [1:1000] "10000000" ...
#>   ..$ patent_title: chr [1:1000] "Coherent LADAR using intra-pixel quadrature"..
#>   ..$ patent_date : chr [1:1000] "2018-06-19" ...
#> 
#> $query_results
#> #### Distinct entity counts across all downloadable pages of output:
#> 
#> total_hits = 5,362,291
```

## Learning more

Head over to the packageâ€™s
[webpage](https://docs.ropensci.org/patentsview/index.html) for more
info, including:

-   A [getting started
    vignette](https://mustberuss.github.io/patentsview/articles/getting-started.html)
    for first-time users.
-   An in-depth tutorial on [writing
    queries](https://mustberuss.github.io/patentsview/articles/writing-queries.html)
-   A list of [basic
    examples](https://mustberuss.github.io/patentsview/articles/examples.html)
-   Two examples of data applications (e.g., a brief analysis of the
    [top
    assignees](https://mustberuss.github.io/patentsview/articles/top-assignees.html)
    in the field of databases)

This package was first introduced in 2017 in an [rOpenSci blog
post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/09/19/patentsview/) which used the
original version of the API. The same content, reworked to use the new
version of the API, is available
[here](https://mustberuss.github.io/patentsview/articles/ropensci_blog_post.html).
A draft of a possible Tech Note about the new version of the API and R
package is
[here](https://mustberuss.github.io/patentsview/articles/ropensci_tech_note.html).
