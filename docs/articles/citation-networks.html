<p>The following is a brief foray into patent citation networks. The
analysis is done on 3 patents that describe patent citation analysis
(PCA) themselves.</p>
<p>The first step is to download the relevant data from the PatentsView
API. We can use the CPC code of <a href="https://worldwide.espacenet.com/classification#!/CPC=Y10S707/933">Y10S707/933</a>
to identify the patents that relate to PCA.</p>

<p>With only 3 patents, it will probably be possible to visualize how
these patents’ cited and citing patents are all related to one another.
Let’s create a list of these “relevant patents” (i.e., the 3 patents
plus all of their cited and citing patents)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and then get a list
of all of their cited patents (i.e., the patents that they cite). This
list of cited patents will allow us to measure how similar the relevant
patents are to one another.</p>

<p><code>full_network</code> contains the similarity score
(<code>cosine_sim</code>) for all patent pairs that share at least one
cited reference in common. This means that it probably contains a lot of
patent pairs that have only one or two cited references in common, and
thus aren’t all that similar. Let’s try to identify a natural level of
<code>cosine_sim</code> to filter on so that our subsequent network is
not too hairy.</p>

<p>There appears to be a smallish group of patent pairs that are very
similar to one another (<code>cosine_sim</code> &gt; 0.8), which makes
it tempting to choose 0.8 as a cutoff point. However, patent pairs that
have reference lists that are this similar to each other are probably
just patents in the same patent family. Let’s choose 0.1 as a cutoff
point instead, as there doesn’t appear to be too many pairs above this
point.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn1"><p>A patent family is a group of related patents, usually
all authored by the same inventor and relating to the same technology.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Defining the network of patents relevant to PCA as those
that cite or are cited by the 3 patents of interest is fairly
restrictive (i.e., it doesn’t adequately capture all of the patents
related to PCA). There are likely patents out there that aren’t cited by
nor cite any of the 3, but are still relevant to PCA. One would need to
measure the similarity between all the patents that are in the general
area of PCA to get a more complete picture of the patents in this area.
This is a much harder problem, though, and would require more analysis
than can fit in a single vignette.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>This is still a pretty arbitrary choice. Take a look at
algorithms like the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/16/6483.full.pdf">disparity
filter</a> for a more systematic way to filter edges.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
