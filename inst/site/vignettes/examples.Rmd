## Patents endpoint

Which patents have been cited by more than 500 US patents?

```{r}
library(patentsview)

search_pv(query = qry_funs$gt(patent_num_cited_by_us_patents = 500))
```

How many distinct inventors are represented by these highly-cited patents?

```{r}
# Setting subent_cnts = TRUE will give us the subentity counts. Since inventors 
# are subentities for the patents endpoint, this means we will get their counts.
search_pv(
  query = qry_funs$gt(patent_num_cited_by_us_patents = 500),
  fields = c("patent_number", "inventor_id"), 
  subent_cnts = TRUE
)
```

Where geographically have Microsoft inventors been coming from over the past 20 years?

```{r}
# Write the query
query <- with_qfuns(
  and(
    gte(patent_date = "2007-07-25"), # Dates are in yyyy-mm-dd format 
    contains(assignee_organization = "microsoft")
  )
)

# Create a field list
inv_fields <- get_fields(endpoint = "patents", groups = "inventors")
fields <- c(inv_fields, "patent_number")

# Pull the data
pv_out <- search_pv(query, fields = fields, all_pages = TRUE)

# Unnest the inventor list column
unnest_pv_data(pv_out$data, "patent_number")
```

## Inventors endpoint

  endpoint = "inventors"
)
```

## Assignees endpoint

Which assignees have an interest in beer?
