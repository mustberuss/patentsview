        designation:Rosa hybrida.\n\nVariety denomination: ‘Poulvic011’.\n\nThis application
        claims priority to Plant Breeder''s Rights Application Number 2023/1984, which
        was filed at the Community Plant Variety Rights Office in the European Union
        on Sep. 22, 2023, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference
        for all purposes.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention constitutes
        a new and distinct variety of rose plant which originated from a controlled
        crossing between the female seed parent, an unnamed seedling, and the male
        pollen parent, also an unnamed seedling. Both of the parent varieties are
        non-patented.\n\nThe two parents were crossed during the summer of 2018 and
        the resulting seeds were planted in a controlled environment in Fredensborg,
        Denmark. The new variety, named ‘Poulvic011’, originated as a single seedling
        from the stated cross.\n\nThe new variety may be distinguished from its male
        pollen parent and female seed parent primarily by the following characteristics.
        The male pollen parent plant has red flowers with over 50 petals while the
        new variety has red flowers with about 38 petals. The female seed parent plant
        has red flowers 60 mm in diameter while the new variety has red flowers 100
        mm in diameter.\n\nThe objective of the hybridization of this rose variety
        was to create a new and distinct variety with unique qualities, such as:1.
        Uniform and abundant red flowers;2. Vigorous, but compact growth when propagated
        on its own roots;3. Exceptional disease resistance.\n\nThis combination of
        qualities is not present in previously available commercial cultivars of this
        type, known to the inventor, and distinguish ‘Poulvic011’ from all other varieties
        of which we are aware.\n\nAs part of the rose development program, Mogens
        N. Olesen germinated the seeds from the aforementioned hybridization during
        winter of 2018 and conducted evaluations on the resulting seedlings in a controlled
        environment in Fredensborg, Denmark. ‘Poulvic011’ was selected in the spring
        of 2019 by the inventor as a single plant from the progeny of the aforementioned
        hybridization.\n\nAsexual reproduction of ‘Poulvic011’ by rooted cuttings
        was first done by Mogens N. Olesen in the nursery in Fredensborg, Denmark
        in July 2019. This initial and other subsequent asexual propagations conducted
        in controlled environments have demonstrated that the characteristics of ‘Poulvic011’
        are true to type and are transmitted from one generation to the next.\n\n"}]}'

        Field\n\nThe present invention relates to the field of rolling cages for soil
        preparation. More specifically, the present invention relates to an object
        removal from inside a rolling cage.\n\nDescription of the Related Art\n\nDisking
        is a soil preparation practice that includes deep or shallow soil tillage.
        By using the best soil tillage practices, farmers can ensure well-prepared
        soil structure. Disking breaks up clods and surface crusts, thereby improving
        soil granulation, surface uniformity and reducing soil erosion. It is typically
        performed at a soil depth of about 4-6 in.\n\nDisc tillage tools can deliver
        high-speed conservation tillage to control stubborn, chemical resistant weed
        growth, while sizing and evenly distributing tough residue throughout the
        worked soil profile. This action kills weeds, limits potential movement of
        wind driven residue, builds soil organic matter by contributing to residue
        breakdown, and helps prevent formation of a residue mat on or below the soil
        surface which could inhibit seed soil contact and movement of moisture and
        nutrients throughout the profile. Various finishing attachments are available
        to provide a consistent, uniform field finish. One such attachment is a soil
        conditioning reel that delivers clod sizing and firming during high-speed
        operation.\n\nA soil conditioning reel may take the form of a single rolling
        cage or series connected rolling cages. Rolling cages are notorious for picking
        up objects (mainly rocks) without a good way to remove them. Rolling cages
        are typically fully welded for durability in field operation.\n\nIn view of
        the above, there is a need for a rolling cage that allows for easy removal
        of rocks and other objects that can be picked and trapped inside of the rolling
        cage.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nAn aspect is a towable rear tool attachment
        configured for soil clod sizing and firming, that can include at least one
        rolling cage that rotates when being towed and is in contact with a soil surface.
        The at least one rolling cage includes a pair of circular-shaped end plates
        located at each end of a respective rolling cage, and a plurality of structural
        members arranged spaced apart around a circumference of the end plates, forming
        a cage-like structure. At least one of the structural members has a removable
        section between the end plates.\n\n"}]}'

        a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements
        does not include only those elements but may include other elements not expressly
        listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus. An element
        preceded by “comprises . . . a” does not, without more constraints, preclude
        the existence of additional identical elements in the process, method, article,
        or apparatus that comprises the element.\n\nAs used herein, the terms “first,”
        “second,” and “third” may be used interchangeably to distinguish one component
        from another and are not intended to signify a location or importance of the
        individual components. The terms “coupled,” “fixed,” “attached to,” and the
        like refer to both direct coupling, fixing, or attaching, as well as indirect
        coupling, fixing, or attaching through one or more intermediate components
        or features, unless otherwise specified herein. The terms “upstream” and “downstream”
        refer to the relative direction with respect to an agricultural product within
        a fluid circuit. For example, “upstream” refers to the direction from which
        an agricultural product flows, and “downstream” refers to the direction to
        which the agricultural product moves. The term “selectively” refers to a component''s
        ability to operate in various states (e.g., an ON state and an OFF state)
        based at least partially on manual and/or automatic control of the component.\n\nFurthermore,
        any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively
        “associated” such that the functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components
        herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as “associated
        with” each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective
        of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so
        associated can also be viewed as being “operably connected” or “operably coupled”
        to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components
        capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being “operably couplable”
        to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Some examples of operably
        couplable include, but are not limited to, physically mateable, physically
        interacting components, wirelessly interactable, wirelessly interacting components,
        logically interacting, and/or logically interactable components.\n\nThe singular
        forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural references unless the context clearly
        dictates otherwise.\n\nApproximating language, as used herein throughout the
        specification and claims, is applied to modify any quantitative representation
        that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function
        to which it is related. Accordingly, a value modified by a term or terms,
        such as “about,” “approximately,” “generally,” and “substantially,” is not
        to be limited to the precise value specified. In at least some instances,
        the approximating language may correspond to the precision of an instrument
        for measuring the value, or the precision of the methods or apparatus for
        constructing or manufacturing the components and/or systems. For example,
        the approximating language may refer to being within a ten percent margin.\n\nMoreover,
        the technology of the present application will be described in relation to
        exemplary embodiments. The word “exemplary” is used herein to mean “serving
        as an example, instance, or illustration.” Any embodiment described herein
        as “exemplary” is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous
        over other embodiments. Additionally, unless specifically identified otherwise,
        all embodiments described herein should be considered exemplary.\n\nAs used
        herein, the term “and/or,” when used in a list of two or more items, means
        that any one of the listed items can be employed by itself, or any combination
        of two or more of the listed items can be employed. For example, if a composition
        or assembly is described as containing components A, B, and/or C, the composition
        or assembly can contain A alone; B alone; C alone; A and B in combination;
        A and C in combination; B and C in combination; or A, B, and C in combination.\n\nIn
        general, the present subject matter is directed to agricultural systems and
        methods for operating the agricultural systems that may incorporate a tillage
        implement. In some cases, the agricultural system includes an implement including
        a frame assembly. One or more ground-engaging tools can be operably supported
        by the frame assembly. An implement actuator can be operably coupled with
        the frame assembly and configured to alter a position of one or more frame
        members of the frame assembly relative to a ground surface.\n\nA computing
        system can be communicatively coupled to the implement actuator. The computing
        system can include a processor and associated memory. The memory stores instructions
        that, when implemented by the processor, can configure the computing system
        to receive data indicative of residue size, determine an implement levelness
        based at least partially on the residue size, and determine an implement actuator
        model based at least partially on the implement levelness. As used herein,
        the implement actuator model defines a position of the one or more implement
        actuators, in order for the frame assembly to be placed at the defined implement
        levelness.\n\nIn various examples, the implement levelness may be compared
        to a levelness range defined by a lower threshold and an upper threshold,
        which may be set to mitigate seedbed levelness issues and/or for any other
        purpose. In some instances, the system may compare the implement levelness
        to the levelness range to ensure that the defined implement levelness does
        not exceed the limits for seedbed floor levelness. In some cases, when the
        determined implement levelness is within the levelness range, the system can
        define an implement actuator model that correlates to the implement levelness
        and, in turn, actuate the one or more implement actuators to modify the position
        of one or more components of the frame assembly (e.g., an angle and position
        of the implement relative to the ground and/or the vehicle) based on the implement
        actuator model. When the determined implement levelness deviates from the
        levelness range, the implement actuator model is set to a maximum offset angle
        when the implement actuator model exceeds an upper threshold of the defined
        levelness range. Likewise, the system can set the implement actuator model
        to a minimum offset angle when the implement actuator model is less than a
        lower threshold of the defined levelness range. In addition, the system can
        continue to observe the potential for/of plugging of the implement based at
        least partially on the frame being placed in the implement actuator model.\n\nReferring
        now to drawings,FIGS.1-4illustrate an agricultural machine10that can include
        a work vehicle12and an associated agricultural implement14. In general, the
        work vehicle12is configured to tow the implement14across a field16in a direction
        of travel (e.g., as indicated by arrow18inFIG.1). In the illustrated examples,
        the work vehicle12is configured as an agricultural tractor and the implement14is
        configured as an associated tillage implement. However, in other embodiments,
        the work vehicle12may be configured as any other suitable type of vehicle,
        such as an agricultural harvester, a self-propelled sprayer, and/or the like.
        Similarly, the implement14may be configured as any other suitable type of
        implement, such as a planter. Furthermore, the agricultural machine10may correspond
        to any suitable powered and/or unpowered agricultural machine10(including
        suitable vehicles and/or equipment, such as only a work vehicle or only an
        implement). Additionally, the agricultural machine10may include two or more
        associated vehicles, implements, and/or the like (e.g., a tractor, a planter,
        and an associated air cart).\n\nAs shown inFIG.1, the work vehicle12includes
        a pair of front track assemblies20, a pair of rear track assemblies22, and
        a frame or chassis24coupled to and supported by the track assemblies20,22.
        An operator''s cab25may be supported by a portion of the chassis24and may
        house various input devices26for permitting an operator to control the operation
        of one or more components of the work vehicle12and/or one or more components
        of the implement14. Additionally, the work vehicle12may include a power source30and
        a transmission32mounted on the chassis24. The transmission32may be operably
        coupled to the power source30and may provide variably adjusted gear ratios
        for transferring power to the track assemblies20,22via a drive axle assembly
        (or via axles if multiple drive axles are employed).\n\nAdditionally, as shown
        inFIG.2, the implement14may generally include a frame assembly34configured
        to be towed by the work vehicle12via a pull hitch or tow bar in the direction
        of travel18of the vehicle12. The frame assembly34may extend along a longitudinal
        direction36between a forward end portion38and an aft end portion40. The frame
        assembly34may also extend along a lateral direction42(FIG.2) between a first
        side portion44and a second side portion46. In this respect, the frame assembly34generally
        includes a plurality of structural frame members48, such as beams, bars, and/or
        the like, configured to support or couple to a plurality of components. Additionally,
        a plurality of wheel assemblies50may be coupled to the frame assembly34, such
        as a set of centrally located wheel assemblies50and a set of front pivoting
        wheel assemblies50, to facilitate towing the implement14in the direction of
        travel18.\n\nThe frame assembly34may be configured to support a plurality
        of ground-engaging tools52, such as a plurality of shanks, disk blades, levelers
        (e.g., leveling blades), basket assemblies, tines, spikes, and/or the like.
        For example, the frame assembly34may be configured to support various gangs
        of disc blades54, a plurality of ground-engaging shanks56, a plurality of
        levelers58(e.g., leveling blades), and a plurality of crumbler wheels or basket
        assemblies60. However, in alternative embodiments, the frame assembly34may
        be configured to support any other suitable ground-engaging tools52and/or
        a combination of ground-engaging tools52. In several embodiments, the various
        ground-engaging tools52may be configured to perform a tillage operation or
        any other suitable ground-engaging operation across the field16along which
        the implement14is being towed. It should be understood that, in addition to
        being towed by the work vehicle12, the implement14may also be a semi-mounted
        implement connected to the work vehicle12via a two-point hitch or the implement14may
        be a fully mounted implement (e.g., mounted the work vehicle''s three-point
        hitch).\n\nWith further reference toFIGS.2-4, various portions of the frame
        assembly34may be adjusted relative to one another. For example, a levelness
        of the frame assembly34may be generally defined by a pitch of the frame assembly34(e.g.,
        as indicated by arrow62inFIG.2) and/or a roll (e.g., as indicated by arrow64inFIG.2)
        of the frame assembly34. In general, the pitch41of the frame assembly34may
        be a differential in the heights of the forward end portion38and the aft end
        portion40of the frame assembly34in the longitudinal direction36of the implement14.
        That is, the frame assembly34may be pitched when the one of the forward or
        aft end portions38,40of the frame assembly34is closer to the ground than the
        other of forward or aft end portions38,40of the frame assembly34. Additionally,
        the roll43of the frame assembly34may be a differential in the heights of the
        first side portion44and the second side portion46of the frame assembly34in
        the lateral direction42of the implement14. That is, the frame assembly34may
        be rolled when the one of the first side portion44and the second side portion46of
        the frame assembly34is closer to the ground than the other of the first side
        portion44and the second side portion46of the frame assembly34.\n\nIn several
        examples, the frame assembly34may include one or more sections. As illustrated
        inFIG.2, for example, the frame assembly34may include a main section66positioned
        centrally between the first side portion44and the second side portion46of
        the frame assembly34. The frame assembly34may also include a first wing section68positioned
        proximate to the first side portion44of the frame assembly34. Similarly, the
        frame assembly34may also include a second wing section70positioned proximate
        to the second side portion46of the frame assembly34. The first and second
        wing sections68,70may be pivotally coupled to the main section66of the frame
        assembly34. In this respect, the first and second wing sections68,70may be
        configured to fold up relative to the main section66to reduce the lateral
        width of the implement14to permit, for example, storage or transportation
        of the implement14on a road. It will be appreciated that the frame assembly34may
        include any suitable number of wing sections.\n\nIn various examples, one
        or more implement actuators72may be configured to adjust the relative positioning
        of one or more components of the implement14and or the work vehicle12to allow
        the pitch and/or the roll of the frame assembly34to be adjusted. Additionally
        or alternatively, the implement actuators72may be used for adjusting one section
        of the frame assembly34relative to another. For example,FIG.3illustrates a
        side view of an implement actuator72configured for adjusting a position of
        one of the wheel assemblies50of the implement14relative to the frame assembly34of
        the implement14, andFIG.4illustrates a side view of an implement actuator72configured
        for adjusting a position of one of the wing sections68,70of the frame assembly34relative
        to the main section66of the frame assembly34. It will be appreciated that
        the implement14can include one or more implement actuators72in any other location
        to adjust the relative positioning of one or more components of the implement14and
        or the work vehicle12without departing from the teachings provided herein.
        Additionally, it will be appreciated that while the implement actuator72in
        the illustrated examples ofFIGS.3and4corresponds to a hydraulic cylinder,
        the implement actuator72may also correspond to any other suitable actuator,
        such as a pneumatic actuator, linear actuator, a solenoid, and/or any other
        practicable assembly.\n\nReferring further toFIG.3, in several examples, the
        wheel assemblies50may be configured to be pivotable or otherwise moveable
        relative to the frame assembly34of the implement14to permit one or more associated
        implement actuators72to adjust the position of the wheel assemblies50relative
        to the frame assembly34. In such examples, the position of the wheel assemblies50relative
        to the frame assembly34may be adjusted to adjust the orientation of the frame
        assembly34in the lateral direction42.\n\nAs shown inFIG.3, in various examples,
        one end portion of the implement actuator72may be pivotably coupled to one
        of the frame members48of the frame assembly34at a pivot joint74. Similarly,
        an opposed end portion of the implement actuator72may also be coupled to a
        pivot arm76of the implement14at a pivot joint78. As shown, the pivot arm76may,
        in turn, pivotably couple the wheel assembly50to the corresponding frame member48of
        the frame assembly34at a pivot joint80. As such, the pivot joints74,78,80may
        allow relative pivotable movement between the frame member48, the pivot arm76,
        and the implement actuator72, thereby allowing the position of the associated
        wheel assembly50relative to the frame assembly34to be adjusted. However, it
        will be appreciated that the wheel assemblies50may be adjustably coupled to
        the frame assembly34in any suitable manner that permits the implement actuator72to
        move the wheel assemblies50relative to the frame assembly34. Furthermore,
        the implement actuator72may be configured to move any of the wheel assemblies50on
        the implement14relative to the frame assembly34.\n\nIn several examples, the
        implement actuator72may correspond to a suitable hydraulic actuator. In such
        examples, the implement actuator72may include both a cylinder82configured
        to house a piston84and a rod86coupled to the piston84that extends outwardly
        from the cylinder82. Additionally, the implement actuator72may include a piston-side
        chamber88and a rod-side chamber90defined within the cylinder82. As is generally
        understood, by regulating the pressure of the fluid supplied to one or both
        of the cylinder chambers88,90, the actuation of the rod86may be controlled.
        As shown inFIG.3, the end portion of the rod86can be coupled to the arm76at
        the pivot joint78, while the cylinder82can be coupled to the frame member48at
        the opposed pivot joint74. However, the end portion of the rod86may be coupled
        to the frame member48at pivot joint74while the cylinder82may be coupled to
        the arm76at the pivot joint78without departing from the teachings provided
        herein.\n\nIn several examples, a suitable pressure regulating valve92(PRV)
        (e.g., a solenoid-activated valve or a manually operated valve) may be configured
        to regulate a supply of fluid (e.g., hydraulic fluid or air from a suitable
        fluid source or tank94) being supplied to the implement actuator72. As shown
        inFIG.3, the PRV92may be in fluid communication with the rod-side chamber90of
        the implement actuator72. In this respect, a fluid conduit96, such as a hose,
        fluidly couples the PRV92to a fitting98on the cylinder82. As such, the PRV92may
        regulate the supply of fluid to the rod-side chamber90. It will be appreciated
        that, in alternate examples, the PRV92may be in fluid communication with the
        piston-side chamber88to regulate the supply of fluid thereto. Alternatively,
        a pair of PRVs92may be in respective fluid communication with one of the chambers88,90of
        the implement actuator72.\n\nReferring now toFIG.4, as indicated above, the
        wing sections68,70of the frame assembly34may be configured to be pivotable
        relative to the main section66of the frame assembly34. As such, one or more
        implement actuators72may be used to adjust the position of the first and/or
        second wing sections68,70relative to the main section66, which may be utilized
        to adjust a roll angle of the implement14.\n\nAs shown inFIG.4, to allow for
        such adjustments, one or more implement actuators72are coupled between each
        wing section68,70, and the main section66of the frame assembly34. In general,
        the actuators220described with reference toFIG.4may be configured the same
        as or similar to the implement actuator72described above with reference toFIG.3.
        For instance, in several examples, the cylinder82of the implement actuator72may
        be pivotably coupled to a post100extending from the main section66of the frame
        assembly34at pivot joint102. Similarly, the rod86of the implement actuator72may
        be pivotably coupled to the corresponding wing section68,70at a pivot joint104.
        Additionally, in various examples, a link106of the implement14may be pivotably
        coupled between the corresponding wing sections68,70, and the main section66at
        pivot joints108,110, respectively. As such, the pivot joints102,104,108,110may
        allow relative pivotable movement between the main section66, the corresponding
        wing section68,70, and the implement actuator72. However, in alternative examples,
        the cylinder82of the implement actuator72may be pivotably coupled to the corresponding
        wing section68,70at the pivot joint104, while the rod86of the implement actuator72may
        pivotably couple to the post100at the pivot joint102.\n\nIt will be appreciated
        that the configuration of the agricultural machine10described above and shown
        inFIGS.1-4is provided only to place the present subject matter in an example
        field of use. Thus, it will be appreciated that the present subject matter
        may be readily adaptable to any manner of machine configurations, including
        any suitable work vehicle configuration and/or implement configuration. For
        example, in an alternative example of the work vehicle12, a separate frame
        or chassis may be provided to which the power source30, transmission, and
        drive axle assembly are coupled, a configuration common in smaller tractors.
        Still other configurations may use an articulated chassis to steer the work
        vehicle12or rely on tires/wheels in lieu of the track assemblies20,22. Similarly,
        as indicated above, the frame assembly34of the implement14may be configured
        to support any other suitable combination of type of ground-engaging tools52.\n\nFurthermore,
        in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter, the agricultural
        machine10may include one or more field sensors112coupled thereto and/or supported
        thereon. Each field sensor112may, for example, be configured to capture data
        indicative of one or more conditions of the field16along which the machine10is
        being traversed. For example, in several examples, the field sensor112may
        be used to collect data associated with one or more conditions of the field16,
        such as residue size, size distribution of the residue (the number or amount
        of residue that falls into each size category), and/or any other suitable
        condition that affects the performance of the implement14.\n\nIn several examples,
        the one or more field sensors112may be provided in operative association with
        the agricultural machine10such that the one or more field sensors112have a
        field of view directed towards a portion(s) of the field adjacent to the work
        vehicle12and/or the implement14, such as a portion(s) of the field disposed
        in front of, behind, and/or along one or both of the side portions of the
        work vehicle12and/or the implement14. For example, as shown inFIG.1, in various
        examples, one or more field sensors112may be provided at a forward end portion114of
        the work vehicle12to allow the one or more field sensors112to capture images
        and related data of a section of the field disposed in front of the work vehicle12.
        Such forward-located field sensors112may allow pre-tillage images of the field
        to be captured for monitoring or determining surface conditions of the field
        prior to the performance of a tillage operation. Similarly, as shown inFIG.1,
        one or more field sensors112may be provided at or adjacent to an aft end portion40of
        the implement14to allow the one or more field sensors112to capture images
        and related data of a section of the field disposed behind the implement14.
        Such aft-located field sensors112may allow post-tillage images of the field
        to be captured for monitoring or determining surface conditions of the field
        after the performance of a tillage operation.\n\nIt will be appreciated that,
        in alternative cases, the one or more field sensors112may be installed at
        any other suitable location(s) on the work vehicle12and/or the implement14.
        In addition, it will be appreciated that, in some cases, the agricultural
        machine10may only include a single field sensor112mounted on either the work
        vehicle12or the implement14or may include more than two field sensors112mounted
        on the work vehicle12and/or the implement14. Moreover, it will be appreciated
        that each field sensor112may be configured to be mounted or otherwise supported
        relative to a portion of the agricultural machine10using any suitable mounting/support
        structure. For instance, each field sensor112may be directly or indirectly
        mounted to a portion of the work vehicle12and/or the implement14. For instance,
        a suitable mounting structure (e.g., mounting arms, brackets, trays, etc.)
        may be used to support each field sensor112in front of the vehicle12or behind
        the implement14(e.g., in a cantilevered arrangement) to allow the one or more
        field sensors112to obtain the desired field of view, including the desired
        orientation of the device''s field of view relative to the field (e.g., a
        straight-down view oriented generally perpendicular to the surface of the
        field).\n\nIn general, the one or more field sensors112may correspond to any
        suitable devices or other assembly configured to capture images. For instance,
        in several examples, the one or more field sensors112may correspond to a camera
        assembly. In such examples, the camera assembly may be used to capture images
        of the field and/or an area proximate thereto. In various examples, the camera
        assembly may include a pair of lenses and a pair of image sensors for capturing
        two-dimensional images. Additionally, by simultaneously capturing an image
        of the same portion of the field with each image sensor, the separate images
        can be combined, compared, and/or otherwise processed to extract three-dimensional
        information about such a portion of the field. For example, by comparing the
        images captured by each camera, a depth image can be generated that allows
        the scene depth to be determined (e.g., relative to the camera) at each corresponding
        pixel location within the imaged portion of the field. As a result, the relative
        depth of specific features or points within the field may be determined. It
        will be appreciated that, in addition to a camera assembly or as an alternative
        thereto, the agricultural machine10may include any other suitable type of
        field sensor112. In several examples, the field sensor112may additionally
        or alternatively correspond to a radio detection and ranging (RADAR) sensor
        system, an ultrasonic sensor, a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensor,
        a sound navigation and ranging (SONAR) sensor, a vision-based sensor, and/or
        any other practicable sensor.\n\nReferring now toFIG.5, a schematic view of
        a system150for an agricultural machine10is illustrated in accordance with
        aspects of the present subject matter. In several examples, the disclosed
        system150is configured for detecting one or more conditions of the field16,
        such as residue size, size distribution of the residue (the number or amount
        of residue that falls into each size category), and/or any other suitable
        condition that affects the performance of the implement14. In turn, the system150may
        perform one or more mitigating operations such that various negative conditions
        that may occur during a tillage operation may be mitigated. The system150will
        generally be described herein with reference to the agricultural machine10described
        above with reference toFIGS.1-4. However, the disclosed system150may generally
        be utilized with agricultural machines having any other suitable machine configuration.\n\nAs
        shown inFIG.5, the system150may include one or more field sensors112configured
        to capture data indicative of various conditions of a region of the field16disposed
        adjacent to the work vehicle12and or the implement14. The system150may further
        include a computing system152communicatively coupled to the field sensor112.
        In several examples, the computing system152may be configured to receive and
        process the data captured by the field sensor112. For instance, the computing
        system152may be configured to receive data indicative of one or more conditions
        of the field16, such as residue size, size distribution of the residue (the
        number or amount of residue that falls into each size category), and/or any
        other suitable condition that affects the performance of the implement14.
        In turn, the computing system152may determine an implement levelness of the
        frame assembly34, and/or portions thereof, based in part on the residue size,
        size distribution of the residue (the number or amount of residue that falls
        into each size category), and/or any other suitable condition that affects
        the performance of the implement14. In some cases, as the residue size and/or
        the size distribution of the residue (the number or amount of residue that
        falls into each size category) varies, the implement levelness of the frame
        assembly34may be adjusted through the one or more implement actuators72to
        process the residue correctly by altering the working depth of the ground-engaging
        tools52to slice through the residue. Based on the implement levelness, the
        system150can determine an implement actuator model that defines a position
        of the one or more implement actuators72in order for the frame assembly34to
        be placed at the defined implement levelness.\n\nIn various examples, the
        implement levelness may be compared to a levelness range defined by a lower
        threshold and an upper threshold, which may set to mitigate seedbed levelness
        issues and/or for any other purpose. In some instances, the system150may compare
        the implement levelness to the levelness range to ensure that the defined
        implement levelness does not exceed the limits for seedbed floor levelness.
        In some cases, when the determined implement levelness is within the levelness
        range, the system150can define an implement actuator model that correlates
        to the implement levelness and, in turn, actuate the one or more implement
        actuators72to modify the position of one or more components of the frame assembly34(e.g.,
        an angle and position of the implement14relative to the ground and/or the
        vehicle12) based on the implement actuator model. When the determined implement
        levelness deviates from the levelness range, the implement actuator model
        is set to a maximum offset angle when the implement actuator model exceeds
        an upper threshold of the defined levelness range. Likewise, the system150can
        set the implement actuator model to a minimum offset angle when the implement
        actuator model is less than a lower threshold of the defined levelness range.
        In addition, the system150can continue to observe the potential for/of plugging
        of the implement14based at least partially on the frame being placed in the
        implement actuator model.\n\nIn general, the computing system152may include
        any suitable processor-based device, such as a computing device or any suitable
        combination of computing devices. Thus, in several examples, the computing
        system152may include one or more processors154and associated memory156configured
        to perform a variety of computer-implemented functions. As used herein, the
        term “processor” refers not only to integrated circuits referred to in the
        art as being included in a computer, but also refers to a controller, a microcontroller,
        a microcomputer, a programmable logic controller (PLC), an application specific
        integrated circuit, and other programmable circuits. Additionally, the memory156of
        the computing system152may generally comprise memory element(s) including,
        but not limited to, a computer-readable medium (e.g., random access memory
        (RAM)), a computer-readable non-volatile medium (e.g., a flash memory), a
        floppy disk, a compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM), a magneto-optical disk
        (MOD), a digital versatile disc (DVD) and/or other suitable memory elements.
        Such memory156may generally be configured to store suitable computer-readable
        instructions that, when implemented by the processors154, configure the computing
        system152to perform various computer-implemented functions, such as one or
        more aspects of the data processing algorithm(s) and/or related method(s)
        described below. In addition, the computing system152may also include various
        other suitable components, such as a communications circuit or module, one
        or more input/output channels, a data/control bus, and/or the like.\n\nIt
        will be appreciated that, in several examples, the computing system152may
        correspond to an existing controller of the agricultural machine10, or the
        computing system152may correspond to one or more separate processing devices.
        For instance, in some examples, the computing system152may form all or part
        of a separate plug-in module or computing device(s) that is installed relative
        to the work vehicle12or implement14to allow for the disclosed system150and
        method to be implemented without requiring additional software to be uploaded
        onto existing control devices of the work vehicle12or implement14.\n\nIn several
        examples, the memory156of the computing system152may include one or more databases158for
        storing information received and/or generated by the computing system152.
        For instance, as shown inFIG.5, the memory156may include a field sensor database160storing
        data associated with the data captured by the field sensor112, including the
        captured data and/or data deriving from the captured data (e.g., disparity
        maps, depth images generated based at least partially on the captured data
        by the field sensor112, etc.). Additionally, the memory156may include a stored
        data database162storing data acquired from various sources. For instance,
        the stored data can include a residue map that is generated through any method,
        such as with a previous agricultural operation, user-entered information,
        from the one or more field sensor112, and/or other systems.\n\nAdditionally
        or alternatively, as shown inFIG.5, the memory156may also include a location
        database164, which may be configured to store location data generated by a
        location device166that is stored in association with the data for later use
        in geo-locating the data relative to the field16. In some examples, the location
        device166may be configured as a satellite navigation positioning device (e.g.
        a GPS, a Galileo positioning system, a Global Navigation satellite system
        (GLONASS), a BeiDou Satellite Navigation and Positioning system, a dead reckoning
        device, and/or the like) to determine the location of the machine10.\n\nMoreover,
        as shown inFIG.5, in several examples, the memory156may also include instructions168that
        may be executed by the processor154to implement a data analysis module170.
        In general, the data analysis module170may be configured to process/analyze
        the captured data received from the field sensor112, the stored data, and/or
        the location data. In various examples, the data analysis module170may be
        configured to execute one or more data processing algorithms to determine
        an implement levelness. In turn, the computing system152may determine an implement
        actuator model based in part on the determined implement levelness and a levelness
        range. In some cases, as the residue size and/or the size distribution of
        the residue varies, the implement actuator model may be adjusted through the
        implement actuators72.\n\nReferring still toFIG.5, in some examples, the instructions168stored
        within the memory156of the computing system152may also be executed by the
        processor154to implement a control module172. In general, the control module172may
        be configured to electronically control the operation of one or more components
        of the agricultural machine10. For instance, in several examples, the control
        module172may be configured to control the operation of the agricultural machine10and/or
        the agricultural implement14based at least partially on the implement actuator
        model. Such control may include altering a position of the frame assembly34(e.g.,
        a pitch and/or a roll of the frame assembly34), which in turn can alter a
        portion of one or more of the ground-engaging tools52of the implement14(e.g.,
        the disc blades54, shanks56, levelers58(e.g., leveling blades), and/or basket
        assemblies60) to proactively or reactively adjust the operation of the implement14in
        view of the monitored surface condition(s).\n\nIn instances in which one or
        more operating parameters are adjusted, the actuation of one or more implement
        components may be based at least partially on data from one or more implement
        sensors174. For example, the one or more implement sensors174can include a
        position sensor176operably coupled with the implement14may detect the change
        in position. In some examples, the position sensor176may be configured as
        an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that measures a specific force, angular
        rate, and/or an orientation of the implement14using a combination of accelerometers,
        gyroscopes, magnetometers, and/or any other practicable device. The accelerometer
        may correspond to one or more multi-axis accelerometers (e.g., one or more
        two-axis or three-axis accelerometers) such that the accelerometer may be
        configured to monitor the movement of the implement14in multiple directions,
        such as by sensing the implement acceleration along three different axes.
        It will be appreciated, however, that the accelerometer may generally correspond
        to any suitable type of accelerometer without departing from the teachings
        provided herein.\n\nIn several examples, the computing system152may also include
        a transceiver178to allow for the computing system152to communicate with various
        components. For instance, one or more communicative links or interfaces (e.g.,
        one or more data buses) may be provided between the transceiver178and a user
        interface180, an electronic device182, and/or any other device.\n\nThe user
        interface180may be housed within the cab25(FIG.1) of the work vehicle12or
        at any other suitable location. The user interface180may be configured to
        provide feedback to the operator of the agricultural machine10. Thus, the
        user interface180may include one or more feedback devices, such as display
        screens, speakers, warning lights, and/or the like, which are configured to
        communicate such feedback. In addition, some examples of the user interface180may
        include one or more touchscreens, keypads, touchpads, knobs, buttons, sliders,
        switches, mice, microphones, and/or the like, which are configured to receive
        user inputs from the operator.\n\nThe electronic device182may include a variety
        of computing systems184including a processor and memory and/or a display186for
        displaying information to a user. For instance, the electronic device182may
        display one or more user interfaces and may be capable of receiving remote
        user input. In addition, the electronic device182may provide feedback information,
        such as visual, audible, and tactile alerts, and/or allow the operator to
        alter or adjust one or more components of the agricultural machine10through
        the usage of the remote electronic device182. For example, the electronic
        device182may be a cell phone, mobile communication device, key fob, wearable
        device (e.g., fitness band, watch, glasses, jewelry, wallet), apparel (e.g.,
        a tee shirt, gloves, shoes, or other accessories), personal digital assistant,
        headphones and/or other devices that include capabilities for wireless communications
        and/or any wired communications protocols.\n\nIt will be appreciated that,
        although the various control functions and/or actions will generally be described
        herein as being executed by the computing system152, one or more of such control
        functions/actions (or portions thereof) may be executed by a separate computing
        system or may be distributed across two or more computing systems (including,
        for example, the computing system152and a separate computing system). For
        instance, in some examples, the computing system152may be configured to acquire
        data from the field sensor112for subsequent processing and/or analysis by
        a separate computing system (e.g., a computing system associated with a remote
        server). In other examples, the computing system152may be configured to execute
        the data analysis module170to determine and/or monitor one or more surface
        conditions within the field16, while a separate computing system (e.g., a
        vehicle computing system152associated with the agricultural machine10) may
        be configured to execute the control module172to control the operation of
        the agricultural machine10based at least partially on data and/or instructions168transmitted
        from the computing system152that are associated with the monitored surface
        condition(s).\n\nReferring toFIG.6, various components of the system150are
        illustrated in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure.
        As shown, the data analysis module170may receive data from various components
        of the system150, such as via the field sensor112, the implement sensors174,
        and/or one or more input devices26. In various cases, the one or more input
        devices26can include one or more user interfaces180for allowing operator inputs
        to be provided to the computing system152(e.g., buttons, knobs, dials, levers,
        joysticks, touch screens, and/or the like), one or more other internal data
        sources188associated with the agricultural machine10(e.g., other devices,
        stored data, databases, etc.), one or more external data sources190(e.g.,
        a remote computing device or server), and/or any other suitable input devices26.\n\nBased
        at least partially on the received data, the control module172can alter or
        manipulate various components of the implement14, such as the implement actuator72.
        As provided herein, the data analysis module170can receive various inputs
        and calculate an implement levelness based at least in part on a residue size,
        a size distribution of the residue, and/or a seedbed floor. In various examples,
        the implement levelness may be compared to a levelness range defined by a
        lower threshold and an upper threshold, which may mitigate seedbed levelness
        issues. In some cases, when the determined implement levelness is within the
        levelness range, the system150can define an implement actuator model that
        correlates to the implement levelness and, in turn, actuate the one or more
        implement actuators72to modify the position of one or more components of the
        frame assembly34causing an angle and position of the implement relative to
        the ground and/or the vehicle12. When the determined implement levelness deviates
        from the levelness range, the system150can set the implement actuator model
        to the upper threshold if the determined implement levelness is above the
        upper threshold. Likewise, the system150can set the implement actuator model
        to the lower threshold if the determined implement levelness is below the
        lower threshold. Therefore, the system150may compare the implement actuator
        model to the levelness range to ensure that the defined implement levelness
        does not exceed the limits for seedbed floor levelness. In some cases, the
        system150may use a look-up table, one or more algorithms, and/or any other
        processes to correlate the implement levelness to the implement actuator model.\n\nIn
        some cases, the implement actuators72may be configured as one or more suitable
        hydraulic actuators. In such cases, the control module172may be configured
        to electronically control the operation of a PRV92to adjust the fluid pressure
        supplied within the implement actuator72. For instance, the computing system152may
        be configured to control the operation of the PRV92such that the fluid pressure
        supplied to the rod-side chamber90(FIGS.3and4) of the implement actuator72is
        increased or decreased when an implement actuator model is to be altered.
        In examples in which the implement actuator is operably coupled with the wheel
        assemblies50of the implement14, increasing the fluid pressure within the rod-side
        chamber90(FIGS.3and4) may cause the rod86(FIGS.3and4) to retract into the
        cylinder82(FIGS.3and4), thereby moving the wheel assemblies50closer to the
        frame assembly34. Conversely, decreasing the fluid pressure within the rod-side
        chamber90may cause the rod86(FIGS.3and4) to extend further from the cylinder82(FIGS.3and4),
        thereby moving the wheel assemblies50farther away to the frame assembly34.
        Pivoting the wheel assembly50upward relative to the frame assembly34(e.g.,
        if a portion of the frame assembly34proximate to that wheel assembly50is farther
        from the ground than the portion of the frame assembly34proximate to another
        of wheel assemblies50) or pivoting the wheel assemblies50downward relative
        to the frame assembly34(e.g., if a portion of the frame assembly34proximate
        to that wheel assembly50is closer from the ground than the portion of the
        frame assembly34proximate to another wheel assembly50) may, for example, allow
        for a corresponding alteration in the roll of the frame assembly34. Additionally
        or alternatively, pivoting each of the wheel assemblies50upward relative to
        the frame assembly34or pivoting each of the wheel assemblies50downward relative
        to the frame assembly34may allow for a corresponding alteration of the roll
        of the frame assembly34.\n\nSimilarly, the control module172may be configured
        to control the operation of the implement actuator72to adjust the position
        of a wing section68,70of the frame assembly34relative to the main section66.
        As such, increasing the fluid pressure within the rod-side chamber90(FIGS.3and4)
        may retract the rod86(FIGS.3and4) into the cylinder82, thereby pivoting the
        wing section68,70upward (i.e., away from the ground) relative to the main
        section66. Conversely, decreasing the fluid pressure within the rod-side chamber90(FIGS.3and4)
        may extend the rod86(FIGS.3and4) farther outward from the cylinder82(FIGS.3and4),
        thereby pivoting the wing section68,70downward (i.e., toward the ground) relative
        to the main section66. Pivoting the wing section68,70upward relative to the
        main section66(e.g., if the wing section68,70is closer to the ground than
        the main section66) or pivoting the wing section68,70upward relative to the
        main section66(e.g., if the wing section68,70is farther from the ground than
        the main section66) may, for example, allow for a corresponding reduction
        in the roll of the frame assembly34, thereby reorienting the frame assembly34across
        the lateral direction42of the implement14.\n\nAdditionally or alternatively,
        the control module172may generate display instructions168for one or more displays192,
        which may be incorporated within the user interface180and/or be remote from
        the user interface180. For instance, the display192may illustrate information
        related to at least one of a residue size, a size distribution of the residue
        (the number or amount of residue that falls into each size category), a defined
        implement levelness, the defined implement levelness relative to a defined
        levelness range, an implement actuator model, and/or any other information.\n\nDuring
        operation, data may be sequentially collected by the field sensor112and/or
        the implement sensors174, which may be provided as subsequent inputs to the
        data analysis module170so that additional alterations to implement actuators72may
        be made, if needed. In addition, the data analysis module170may alter one
        or more subsequent outputs based at least partially on a result of a previous
        instruction. As such, the data analysis module170may learn from the results
        of previous instructions to alter subsequent instructions.\n\nReferring now
        toFIG.7, a flow diagram of a method200for operating an agricultural system
        is illustrated in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. In
        general, the method200will be described herein with reference to the agricultural
        machine10shown inFIGS.1-4and the various system components shown inFIGS.5and6.
        However, it will be appreciated that the disclosed method200may be implemented
        with agricultural machines having any other suitable machine configurations
        and/or within systems having any other suitable system configuration without
        deviating from the present disclosure. In addition, althoughFIG.7depicts steps
        performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion,
        the methods discussed herein are not limited to any particular order or arrangement.
        One skilled in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will appreciate
        that various steps of the methods disclosed herein can be omitted, rearranged,
        combined, and/or adapted in various ways without deviating from the scope
        of the present disclosure.\n\nAs illustrated, at (202), the method200can include
        receiving data indicative of residue size. Additionally or alternatively,
        at (204), the method200can include receiving data indicative of a size distribution
        of the residue. In some cases, the residue size and/or the size distribution
        data may be received from the one or more field sensors and/or one or more
        input devices.\n\nAt (206), the method200can include determining an implement
        levelness based at least partially on the residue size with a computing system.
        Additionally or alternatively, the implement levelness can be based at least
        partially on the residue size distribution.\n\nAt (208), the method200can
        include determining an implement actuator model based at least partially on
        the implement levelness with a computing system. As provided herein, the implement
        actuator model can be a defined position for each of the one or more implement
        actuators to place the implement in the defined implement levelness.\n\nIn
        various examples, the implement levelness may be compared to a levelness range
        defined by a lower threshold and an upper threshold, which may correspond
        to a seedbed of the field. In some instances, the method can include comparing
        the implement actuator model to the levelness range to ensure that the defined
        implement levelness does not exceed the limits for seedbed floor levelness.
        In some cases, when the determined implement levelness is within the levelness
        range, the system can define an implement actuator model that correlates to
        the implement levelness and, in turn, actuate the one or more implement actuators
        to modify the position of one or more components of the frame assembly (e.g.,
        an angle and position of the implement relative to the ground and/or the vehicle).
        When the determined implement levelness deviates from the levelness range,
        the implement actuator model may be set to a maximum offset angle when the
        implement actuator model exceeds an upper threshold of the defined levelness
        range. Likewise, the implement actuator model may be set to a minimum offset
        angle when the implement actuator model is less than a lower threshold of
        the defined levelness range. In addition, the system can continue to observe
        the potential for/of plugging of the implement based at least partially on
        the frame being placed in the implement actuator model.\n\nAt (210), the method200can
        include generating instructions to actuate an implement actuator to place
        the frame assembly in the implement actuator model with the computing system.
        Additionally or alternatively, at (212), the method200can include generating
        a graphic related to at least one of the residue size, the size distribution
        of the residue, a defined implement levelness, the defined implement levelness
        relative to a defined levelness range, or the implement actuator model on
        a display with the computing system.\n\nIn various examples, the method200may
        implement machine learning methods and algorithms that utilize one or several
        machine learning techniques including, for example, decision tree learning,
        including, for example, random forest or conditional inference trees methods,
        neural networks, support vector vehicles, clustering, and Bayesian networks.
        These algorithms can include computer-executable code that can be retrieved
        by the computing system and/or through a network/cloud and may be used to
        evaluate and update the boom deflection model. In some instances, the machine
        learning engine may allow for changes to the boom deflection model to be performed
        without human intervention.\n\nIt is to be understood that the steps of any
        method disclosed herein may be performed by a computing system upon loading
        and executing software code or instructions that are tangibly stored on a
        tangible computer-readable medium, such as on a magnetic medium, e.g., a computer
        hard drive, an optical medium, e.g., an optical disc, solid-state memory,
        e.g., flash memory, or other storage media known in the art. Thus, any of
        the functionality performed by the computing system described herein, such
        as any of the disclosed methods, may be implemented in software code or instructions
        that are tangibly stored on a tangible computer-readable medium. The computing
        system loads the software code or instructions via a direct interface with
        the computer-readable medium or via a wired and/or wireless network. Upon
        loading and executing such software code or instructions by the computing
        system, the computing system may perform any of the functionality of the computing
        system described herein, including any steps of the disclosed methods.\n\nThe
        term “software code” or “code” used herein refers to any instructions or set
        of instructions that influence the operation of a computer or controller.
        They may exist in a computer-executable form, such as vehicle code, which
        is the set of instructions and data directly executed by a computer''s central
        processing unit or by a controller, a human-understandable form, such as source
        code, which may be compiled in order to be executed by a computer''s central
        processing unit or by a controller, or an intermediate form, such as object
        code, which is produced by a compiler. As used herein, the term “software
        code” or “code” also includes any human-understandable computer instructions
        or set of instructions, e.g., a script, that may be executed on the fly with
        the aid of an interpreter executed by a computer''s central processing unit
        or by a controller.\n\nThis written description uses examples to disclose
        the technology, including the best mode, and also to enable any person skilled
        in the art to practice the technology, including making and using any devices
        or systems and performing any incorporated methods. The patentable scope of
        the technology is defined by the claims, and may include other examples that
        occur to those skilled in the art. Such other examples are intended to be
        within the scope of the claims if they include structural elements that do
        not differ from the literal language of the claims, or if they include equivalent
        structural elements with insubstantial differences from the literal language
        of the claims.\n\n","description_length":54795}]}'
