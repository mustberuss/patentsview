With the recent [API changes](api-changes.html), the patent endpoint is the main way to retrieve data. The other 
endpoints supply additional information.  Also note that an API key is required.

## Patent endpoint

Which patents have been cited by more than 500 US patents?

```{r}
library(patentsview)

search_pv(query = qry_funs$gt(patent_num_times_cited_by_us_patents = 500))
```

How many distinct inventors are represented by these highly-cited patents?

```{r}

search_pv(
  query = qry_funs$gt(patent_num_times_cited_by_us_patents = 500),
  fields = c("patent_id", "inventors.inventor_id")
)
```
What assignee's organizations start Microsoft?

```{r}
query <- qry_funs$begins(assignee_organization = "Microsoft")

pv_out <- search_pv(query, endpoint = "assignee")
pv_out$data$assignees$assignee_organization
```

Where geographically have Microsoft inventors been coming from over the past few years?

```{r}
# Write the query
query <- with_qfuns(
  and(
    gte(patent_date = "2022-07-26"), # Dates are in yyyy-mm-dd format
    begins(assignees.assignee_organization = "Microsoft")
  )
)

# Create a field list by getting the inventors fields- the primary key is needed
# for unnest_pv_data()
inv_fields <- get_fields(endpoint = "patent", groups="inventors", include_pk = TRUE)

# Pull the data
pv_out <- search_pv(query, fields = inv_fields, all_pages = TRUE, size = 1000)

# Unnest the inventor list column
unnest_pv_data(pv_out$data, "patent_id")
```

## Inventor Endpoint

Which inventor's most recent patent has Chicago, IL listed as their location.

```{r}
pv_out <- search_pv(
  query = '{"_and":[{"_text_phrase": {"inventor_lastknown_city":"Chicago"}},
                    {"_text_phrase": {"inventor_lastknown_state":"IL"}}]}',
  endpoint = "inventor"
)

pv_out

```
 In the new version of the API, the behavior of this endpoint has changed.  See the similar example
on the [legacy inventors endpoint](https://patentsview.org/apis/api-endpoints/inventors) page
for its original behavior.

We could also call the new version of the patent endpoint to find inventors who listed
Chicago, IL as their location when applying for a patent.

```{r}
fields <- get_fields('patent', groups="inventors", include_pk = TRUE)
fields

query <- '{"_and":[{"_text_phrase": {"inventors.inventor_city":"Chicago"}},
                   {"_text_phrase": {"inventors.inventor_state":"IL"}}]}'

search_pv(query, fields=fields, endpoint="patent")

```

Note that here all the inventors on a particular patent will be returned, not just the ones whose
location was Chicago, IL.  Also see the [Writing Queries Vignette](writing-queries.html) for more readable ways
to write queries.

## Assignee Endpoint

Which assignees have an interest in beer?

```{r}
search_pv(
  query = qry_funs$contains(patent_title = "beer"),
  endpoint = "patent"
)
```
