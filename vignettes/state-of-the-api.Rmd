There's a lot going on with the new version of the Patentsview API, recently renamed
PatentSearch API, as announced [here](https://search.patentsview.org/docs/#naming-update).

## On the Plus Side

Here are the positive API changes:

* All fields can be queried now.

* The 100,000 row result set size limit seems to be gone.  Might be part curse as a user might not have
intended to [retrieve all utility patents](api-changes.html#unbounded) etc.

* The new version of the API returns data in types other than strings, e.g. application.rule_47_flag from the patent endpoint is a boolean.  ```View(fieldsdf[grep('number|integer|boolean',fieldsdf$data_type),c("endpoint","field","data_type")])``` currently returns 90 rows

  There are still a few fields where the API returns strings that `cast-pv-data()` casts to a more appropriate data type[^7].
fieldsdf$data_type is set to int or bool for these fields.

  ```{r}
library(patentsview)

# Count of non string, non date fields returned by the new version of the API
nrow(fieldsdf[grep("number|integer|boolean", fieldsdf$data_type), ])

print(fieldsdf[grep("bool$|int$", fieldsdf$data_type), c("endpoint", "field", "data_type")], row.names = FALSE)
  ```
* The API team created a [Swagger UI](patentsview-breaking-change.html#online-documentation) page for the new version of the API. 
It has a nice feature where it will show you what the Request URL was for a GET request.
The Request URL can be passed to `retrieve_linked_data` to see its output from the R package, 
as explained below. On a POST request, it will show you the Curl command that will make
the same request to the API.  It can be helpful to see the exact return from the API,
making it possible to tell if the results weren't what you expected or if the R package
is somehow misinterpreting them. On other [Joys of Swagger UI](https://patentsview.historicip.com/swagger/articles/)

## Issues
* The 2024-11-06 API release seems to have intentionally changed paging by patent_id, details [below](#big-trouble)
* The original API's sunset date is currently February 12, 2025 though the new version 
still has [issues](api-changes.html#things-to-note)
* On a new [string case sensitivity](api-changes.html#case-sensitivity-caveat), opened as a [bug](#case-dependent) listed below
* On [string vs full text operators](api-changes.html#string-and-full-text-operators), also opened as a bug listed below.
Note that there isn't a way to distinguish strings and full text fields in the OpenAPI object
(limitation of the OpenAPI spec).  We may need to change the way fieldsdf is generated
if we need to track what operators can be used, possibly parsing the [API's endpoints page](https://search.patentsview.org/docs/docs/Search%20API/SearchAPIReference/#endpoints)

* API Oddities
   + Some [requested fields](api-changes.html#slight-weirdness) ending with _id come back without the _id[^4] 
Ex patent endpoint requested inventors.inventor_id and
assignees.assignee_id are returned as inventors.inventor and assignees.assignee, their values are
their respective HATEOAS links

   + Two of the [HATEOAS links](api-changes.html#hateoas-links) use a colon instead of having two URL parameters
      * https[]()://search.patentsview.org/api/v1/cpc_group/G01S7:4865/
      * https[]()://search.patentsview.org/api/v1/uspc_subclass/403:57/ (endpoint currently throws a 500)

      An [API key](api-changes.html#an-api-key-is-required) is now required so, intentionally, these URLs aren't clickable since no API key would be sent, resulting in a 403 Forbidden response.

   + Field inconsistencies
      * There are two rule_47_flag fields, one returned by the patent endpoint and one returned by the
publication endpoint.  The former is returned as a boolean, the latter as a string that cast-pv-data casts to a boolean.[^1]

      * assignee_type, available from three endpoints, is returned as a string but looks like they're integer values[^3]

      * Most document_number fields are integers but there are two that are returned as strings
that cast-pv-data casts to integers.[^2] [Additional details](getting-started.html#casting-fields)

   + Most endpoints' returns are the plural form of the singular endpoint with these two exceptions: 

     |endpoint|returned entity|
     |--------|---------------|
     |ipc|ipcr|
     |wipo|wipo|

   +  Two endpoints, publication/rel_app_text and patent/|rel_app_text return the same
entity, rel_app_texts.

   + Not exactly an oddity, but with no better place for this, here's a comparison of the old and 
new attributes that can be sent to the API in its o: (options) parameter via `search_pv()`

     |Original API|New Version| Purpose|
     |------------|-----------|--------|
     | per_page (max 10,000)  | size (max 1,000)     |  maximum number of rows to return on each request |
     | page       | after     |  page through large result sets |
     | subent_cnts|           |  whether the query results should include the total counts of unique subentities|
     | mtchd_subent_only|     | whether a query should return all related subentities or just those that match query criteria.|

   + As another not-exactly-an-oddity, the API's sort on patent_id, a string field, gets funky when mixing
patent ids above and below 10,000,000 (the ones 10M and above come first).   The same thing happens with
other patent types, like reissue, when the ids have different string lengths.  See the code block at 
the bottom of the [understanding the api](understanding-the-api.html#unexpected-results) vignette.

   + Along the same lines, this query currently returns 2,084,459 rows when that isn't 
at all what I expected!  (I checked and the original version of the API did this too.)
```{"_and":[{"_gte":{"patent_id":"10"}},{"_lte":{"patent_id":"13"}}]}```

   + These oddities are not specific to the new version of the API, but are due to the
source files that make up the patentsview database.  I opened these issues as API bug
PVS-1342 "Underlying data issues", with slighly more diplomatic wording.  It's my
expectation that I'd get the same results by querying [ppubs' advanced search](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/search/patent-public-search) 
as I would with patentsview.  Differences due to disambiguation would be one thing,
but I'm expecting the underlying data to be the same.
     * One of the weirdest things is that there are approximately 8000 withdrawn patents 
in the patentsview database.  The source of the database is the [bulk xml files](https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/) the US Patent Office releases weekly.  The problem is that sometimes patents are withdrawn after appearing in a bulk xml file but they are kept 
in the patentsview database alongside non withdrawn patents.  How weird is that?  Here is the Patent Office's [withdrawn patent list](http://www.uspto.gov/patents-application-process/patent-search/withdrawn-patent-numbers), which is updated weekly.  See
test_that("withdrawn patents are still present in the database") in test-api-bugs.R

     * An equally strange situation is the approximately 300 non-withdrawn patents that, for whatever reason, did not appear in the bulk xml file for the week they were issued.  They are granted patents that are not in the patentsview database.  See test_that("missing patents are still missing") in test-api-bugs.R

     *  Also, not sure why, but there aren't any design patents before 1976-12-07 or plant patents
before 1976-12-14 while there are utility and reissue patents starting 1976-01-06.  See [this page](result-set-paging.html#missing)

      * Plant patents and reissued patents do not have current CPC assignments where appropriate.  The problem is that the bulk Cooperative Patent Classification file for granted patents, produced the USPTO quarterly, only contains assignments for utility patents.  I didn't
check but am assuming the USPTO's bulk CPC file for applications only contains current
CPCs for utility patents.

        The patentsview database does have cpc_at_issue fields for these patents but they only have cpc_current fields for utility patents.  E.g., thousands of plant patents have A01H 5/02 as one of their current CPCs in
[ppubs](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/external.html?db=USPAT&type=queryString&q=PP$.pn.%20AND%20A01H5/02.cpc.) yet none have it in the patentsview database.
      * There is a similar problem with USPCs. The US Patent stopped assigning them to 
utility patent in 2015, in favor of CPCs.  They are still used, however, on plant 
patents, yet the US Patent office stopped producing a bulk file of USPCs in 2018. 
Plant patents do have their uspc_at_issue fields set in the patentsview database, but 
the API does not have a uspc_current field.

        The lack of current CPCs and USPCs on plant patents means your classification searches
aren't being preformed on the same version of the corresponding classification system.
Here's a page showing how often the [CPC changes](https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/cpcSchemeAndDefinitions).
Here's a page that shows that [USPC change orders](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/search/understanding-patent-classifications/classification-orders) 
stopped in 2013.  If you are doing classification searches on plant patents,
you may want to use [ppubs](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/) or some other system.

## Open API Bugs

Weirdly, you can only view bugs you've submitted.  Based on the digits in the reference number, I'm assuming 
there are other open bugs.

~~PVS-1109~~ This is fixed <a name="otherreference">  
The otherreference endpoint rejects the default [Swagger UI](https://search.patentsview.org/swagger-ui/) parameters (throws a 400 Bad Request Error if
either reference_sequence or reference_text is requested) and returns no data when only
patent_id is requested. See test_that("the otherreferences endpoint is still broken") in test-api-bugs.R
Also, the OpenAPI object says the returned object is other_references which 
is another exception to the singular endpoint/plural return pattern[^6].

PVS-1125	
Not all the fields in the OpenAPI object can be requested
See test_that("each field in fieldsdf can be retrieved") in test-api-bugs.R

PVS-1147 <a name="case-dependent">	
Results are case dependent now when using an implied or explicit equals
See test_that("there is case sensitivity on string equals") in test-api-bugs.R

~~PVS-1155~~ This is fixed  
Documentation inconsistencies  
The endpoint is listed as /api/v1/attorney/, it should be /api/v1/patent/attorney for the GET/POST and /api/v1/patent/attorney/{attorney_id}/ for the GET with a url parameter
The beta endpoints say they are only GETs. The Swagger UI page and OpenAPI object say they accept posts too, which do work.

PVS-1181  
Improvement Suggestion  
There isn't a data dictionary for the API like there is for the bulk download files.
A specific question would be what is the difference between patent_earliest_application_date and application.filing_date returned by the new patent endpoint. 
Other questions would be what do the values of the assignees.assignee_type field represent, are they all integers and if so should the field be received as an integer rather than a string?

PVS-1218	
openapi.json errors
  
* Fixed: ~~"publication","us_parties.applicant_authority" has a type of "keyword" when it should be "string"~~

* There are two rule_47_flag fields, one is a boolean (line 7019), the other is a string (line 8004) 

* Most of the document_numbers are integers but citation_document_number from patent/us_application_citation
is a string.  document_number from publication/rel_app_text is now correctly coming back as an integer.

~~PVS-1306~~  This is fixed  
The API accepts invalid fields  
The API accepts invalid fields that start out looking like valid fields when it should throw an error. 
Ex f: is["patent_iddddddddddddd", "patent_dateagogo"] and q: is {"patent_idd":"10000000"} with this result: { "error": false, "count": 0, "total_hits": 0, "patents": [] }
See test_that("invalid fields are accepted") in test-api-bugs.R

PVS-1342  
Underlying data issues  
There are ~300 issued patents are missing from the database, ~8000 withdrawn patents are present
in the database, and plant patents and reissued patents don't have current CPC assigments when
applicable.  I didn't check but am assuming the bulk CPC file for applications and the 
publication endpoint have the same issue. (There's more detail above as the last API oddity)

PVS-1377  
The sort field doesn't accept all unnested fields   
The API throws errors when some fields are specified as the sort, e.g. patent_title at the
patent endpoint.  39 other endpoint/field pairs currently fail.  See test_that("we can't sort by all fields") in test-api-bugs.R

Unknown Reference Number  
A sort field needs to be specified when paging results.  
This was mentioned as a bug in the [API's forum](https://patentsview.org/forum/7/topic/804#comment-749).
It causes some awkardness in search_pv (we add a sort field and the primary key if not included
in fields.  Awkard if no fields were specified)

PVS-1435  <a name="big-trouble">  
**Paging seems to have been changed with a recent API release**  
test_that("the 'after' parameter works properly") in test-search-pv.R broke,
as did the [paging vignette](result-set-paging.html).
Their first requests have a total_hits of 3003 with 1000 rows returned but the
subsequent requests return 399 rows when we set the 'after' parameter to the unaltered
value of the last patent_id we received.

Here's the new reality:  if the after: parameter is the value of a patent_id, it needs to 
be padded to 8 characters.  E.g. "6010555" needs to be submitted as ```{"after": "06010555"}```,
"RE36479" needs to become ```{"after": "RE036479"}```.  This seems to be an intentional change
so that sorting by patent_id doesn't behave oddly above and below 10,000,000 (where the leading 1
put anything above 10M before anything below 10M).  As a result, paging by patent_id now requires
padding.  Not sure if querying by patent_id would also need to be padded, I feel a test case
coming on.  Oh, and the R package has a new method, `pad_patent_id()` should you need to pad patent_ids.


## State of the R Package

* [Three new methods](api-changes.html#additional-r-package-changes) were added to the R package

* The reworked [ropensci post](ropensci-blog-post.html) explains what changes had to be made since assignee 
latitude and longitude are no longer available from the patent endpoint.

* A new vignette, inspired by the API team's jupyter notebook, was created showing two of the things it mentions

  1. The API and now the R package allow nested attributes to be [wildcarded](understanding-the-api.html#fields-shorthand),
where the group's name will retrieve all the group's nested fields.  An empty string can also be passed as a group name to `get_fields()`
which then requests all the non-nested attributes from the endpoint. Ex. ```get_fields("patent", group=c("", "inventors")```

  2. On [applying multiple conditions to related-entity fields](understanding-the-api.html#unexpected-results)

* The endpoints are now singular, to match the API's change.  Some of the new endpoints are nested under patent/ and one is nested under publication/,
also matching the API's change
  ```{r}
print(unique(fieldsdf[grep("/", fieldsdf$endpoint), "endpoint"]), row.names = FALSE)
  ```

* There's a new, optional, include_pk parameter on `get_fields()` that defaults to FALSE.
It's useful if you're planning on unnesting the return from `search_pv()`.
  ```{r}
fields <- get_fields(endpoint = "patent", groups = c("inventors"), include_pk = TRUE)
results <- search_pv(
  query = '{"_gte":{"patent_date":"2007-01-04"}}',
  fields = fields
)
unnest_pv_data(results$data)
  ```

* Under the covers, httr was changed to httr2 (see several mentions below).  This only matters to users if 
they passed additional arguments (...) to `search_pv()`.  Previously if they passed config = httr::timeout(40)
they'd now pass timeout = 40 (name-value pairs of valid curl options, as found in `curl::curl_options()`)

* Now that the R package is using httr2, users can make use of its last_request() method to see what was
sent to the API.  This could be useful when trying to fix an invalid request. Note that when `all_pages = TRUE`
the R package changes the sort parameter (details [here](result-set-paging.html)) and sets the 'after' 
options parameter so the request shown might not be what you'd expect it to be.  Also fun, or useful, when
reporting a bug, would be seeing the raw API response.
```
httr2::last_request()
httr2::last_response()
httr2::last_response() |> httr2::resp_body_json() 
```

* Package contributor specific changes

    + Changed httr to httr2 as [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/index.html) says it's superseded by [httr2](https://httr2.r-lib.org/)
It's trying to put us out of business by handling 429 retries etc.  See their 
[Wrapping APIs vignette](https://httr2.r-lib.org/articles/wrapping-apis.html)

  + My github repo is set to deliver to https://mustberuss.r-universe.dev/patentsview.  The new
version of the R package can be installed via   
```install.packages('patentsview', repos = c('https://mustberuss.r-universe.dev'))```

  + On the new [implementation of paging](api-changes.html#a-note-on-paging) and the
[PR discussion](https://github.com/ropensci/patentsview/pull/29#discussion_r1059153136) on paging with more than a primary sort.
**This added a dependency to data.table.**  There is also a [new vignette](result-set-paging.html) on the new implementation of paging

  + The patent/otherreference endpoint isn't currently working (reported as a [bug](#otherreference) above).
It isn't included in the return of get_endpoints() and has only a negative test case that will
fail when the API responds with something other than an error.

  + The R package unit tests have some skips and other negative tests that API bugs still exist
(they'll fail when bugs are fixed).  The tests were copied to
[a single file](https://github.com/mustberuss/patentsview/blob/api-redesign/tests/testthat/test-api-bugs.R) that
was then submitted to the API team as bugs.  Most of the tests exist
in other test files but a few are unique (specific to API bugs that won't be needed
once they're fixed).

  + A possible [tech note](patentsview-breaking-change.html) for when the new package is ready mentions

    > As shown in the updated [Top Assignees vignette](top-assignees.html), there will be occasions now where multiple API calls are needed to retrieve the same data as in a single API call in the original version of the API and R package.

  + The workflow (R-CMD-check.yaml) was updated to get rid of deprecated warnings

  + Added vignettes/build_some.R to half render one or more of the vignettes during development

  + Added a ```bootstrap: 5``` to _pkgdown.yml so the search box would display (Maëlle's [PR](https://github.com/ropensci/patentsview/pull/34))

  + The R package handles [throttling](api-changes.html#throttling), which the new version of the API now imposes

  + data-raw/fieldsdf.R is working again!  There is some hard-coding that can be removed when
bugs are fixed.  We may need to retain some of the hard-coding, see the comments in data-raw/fieldsdf.R

  + renamed test-arg-validation.R to test-validate-args.R for code coverage match up

  + <a name="improvements"> Possible Package Improvements

    * The version number ought to be bumped to 1.0.0 since there are breaking API changes (singular endpoints and the addition of an API key).  validate-args.R has some version
specific code that may need modifying. A draft of a release would look something like this:
![pre-release](https://patentsview.historicip.com/release.png)

    * Result set size seems unbounded now.  Should we warn if a query would return more than 100,000 rows with all_pages = TRUE?  Or maybe add a max_rows to search_pv()?
    * Have get_fields() and search_pv() throw a specialized error if a plural endpoint is passed
    * Add an issue template that warns users not to share their API key
    * Add a contributing.md or something that explains how to build everything, something like
[Findings/Contributor 101](#findingscontributor-101) below
    * Navigation on the vignettes could be better, the possible [tech note](patentsview-breaking-change.html) and the reworked [ropensci blog post](ropensci-blog-post.html) aren't part of the navigation.
    * Not sure if there should be a monster comment in search_pv.R trying to explain 
the new way of paging.  Possibly just say to see the new [api paging vignette](result-set-paging.html)?
    * [Sign up](https://coveralls.io/sign-up) for coveralls and add a code coverage badge?
    * httr2 improvements
       + Currently requests are set to be retried 19 times ```httr2::req_retry(max_tries = 20)```  Is this a reasonable
number? 429 errors can occur if the user runs more than a single program at a time, like half
rendering while devtools::test() is running or running anything locally while an action is running in your 
repo because of a push.   Errors did not occur when the retries were recursive, whether that was intended or not!
       + Can the throttled test detect output to stdout etc?  We used to expect_message "The API's requests
per minute limit has been reached." Now "Waiting 45s for retry backoff" appears but doesn't satisfy
expect_message().  Currently it's using system.time() to assert that 50 transactions took over 60 seconds,
implying that throttlilng occurred.


## Worth Monitoring

bergant/rapiclient has a new maintainer and [he's in favor](https://github.com/bergant/rapiclient/issues/11#issuecomment-2383483280)
of supporting OpenAPI v3 though he thinks that would warrant a new package.   The R version of the fieldsdf creator
is working again!  It uses rapiclient which is expecting to read a Swagger/OpenAPI v2 object
(the patentsview object is OpenAPI v3).  It throws a warning but seems to work otherwise.

## Findings/Contributor 101

Helpful info after you've forked https://github.com/ropensci/patentsview 

* API related

  + Updated versions of the new API are unannounced for the most part, maybe on a three 
or four week release cycle, often on 
Saturdays.  I do head requests from time to time on the [API's OpenAPI object](https://search.patentsview.org/static/openapi.json)
to detect when its Last-Modified changes. When it changes, I back up data-raw/fieldsdf.csv, run data-raw/fieldsdf.R and 
compare the backed up fieldsdf.csv to the new one to see what, if anything, changed. (It seems
they update openapi.json on a release, whether it changed or not.)  

    If it did change, I'll do a local build to incorporate the changed fieldsdf. Either way (openapi.json changed or not), I'll
run all the tests to see if any fail, especially noting if test_that("the endpoints are stable")
fails, indicting changes in endpoints. I'll then push any changes needed
to keep the R package working and the tests passing, sometimes half rendering vignettes
if they are affected by the change.  Quarterly or so they'll update https://patentsview.org/release-notes  

  + Request an API key, report API suggestions/bugs etc [here](https://patentsview-support.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
or Community -> Support using the nav on [patentsview.org](httsp://patentsview.org).

  + Now all the endpoints are documented on a [single page](https://search.patentsview.org/docs/docs/Search%20API/SearchAPIReference/#endpoints).
The [query language]( https://search.patentsview.org/docs/docs/Search%20API/SearchAPIReference/#api-query-language) is also on that same page.
Originally there was a separate page for the query language and each endpoint had its own page.

  + The patentsview forum isn't terribly active but it's worth keeping an eye on
https://patentsview.org/forum

* Locally

  + Build and install the local code ```devtools::install('.')```

     You can also do a full blown local build but you'll need to clean up afterwards (delete
     the gz and patentsview.Rcheck  directory).  This runs the same things the github action runs 
     on pushes to ropensci/patentsview (including running the tests with skip_on_cran() being TRUE)
     This can be useful to catch missing skip_on_cran()'s or undocumented parameters etc.
     Without the `--no-manual` it'll try to create a pdf of the documentation, which can fail 
     if pdflatex is not available. It's probably a good idea to run without PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY in 
     your environment.

     ```
     system("R CMD build .")   
     system("R CMD check patentsview_0.3.0.tar.gz --no-manual")
     ```

  + rscript data-raw/fieldsdf.R to run the fieldsdf creator locally.  It parses the Patentsview OpenAPI object to 
produce fieldsdf.csv and fieldsdf.rda

  + Local Testing

    * devtools::test()  to run all the tests in tests/testthat/

    * devtools::test(filter="utils") to just run just test-utils.R

    * note that if you add new test methods, they must start with `skip_on_cran()` or builds will fail on r-universe (see Optional below) and eventually on CRAN.

  + Half building vignettes locally - see vignettes/README.md

    * need phantomjs in your path on windows at least

    * see the comments in vignettes/build_some.R 

  + pkgdown locally

    * pkgdown::build_articles() to see local changes to half-rendered vignettes 

    *  You may want to run individual methods or 
[pkgdown::build_site()](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_site.html) which is a wrapper for 
       + init_site()
       + build_home()
       + build_reference()
       + build_articles()
       + build_tutorials()
       + build_news()
       + build_redirects()
<br />
<br />
   + build reference pages locally   
    If you make changes to method documentation, run   
    `devtools::document()`  
    `pkgdown::build_reference()`

   + To see README.Rmd changes locally
    ```
    knitr::knit("README.Rmd", "README.md")
    pkgdown::build_home()
    ```

   + Run code coverage locally on the whole package: `devtools::test_coverage()` or
```devtools::test_coverage(function_exclusions = "\\.onLoad")``` or on an 
individual file: ```devtools::test_coverage_active_file(file = "R/print.R")``` You'd need to have covr installed
<br />
<br />
* Remotely

  + pkgdown remotely   
   You can set up github pages in your repo to display vignettes and man pages, e.g. https://github.com/mustberuss/patentsview

  + Remote Testing   
You can put your API key in your repo as a Repository secret so the tests will run when you push changes.
 E.g., I have PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY set in 
https://github.com/mustberuss/patentsview/settings/secrets/actions (though settings aren't publicly
viewable)

* Before doing a push 

  + make sure you are following the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
There are plugins to keep you stylish ```styler::style_pkg(".", dry = "fail")``` or 
```styler::style_file('path/file')``` if necessary or use a plugin etc

   + make sure the examples still run ```devtools::run_examples(run_dontrun = TRUE)```

   + check spelling using ```devtools::spell_check(pkg = ".", vignettes = TRUE, use_wordlist = TRUE)```
Locally I have an unchecked in inst/WORDLIST with additional words to allow (one word per line)
see https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/spell_check.html
 
* Optional

  + you can set up your own r-universe by creating a special github repo, as explained 
[here](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/06/22/setup-runiverse/).
E.g., https://github.com/mustberuss/mustberuss.r-universe.dev
with https://github.com/mustberuss/mustberuss.r-universe.dev/blob/master/packages.json
See [this article](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/02/07/runiverse-registry-repo/) on the newer repo naming convention
<br />
<br />
* Notes
   + It's a good idea to review the action logs, even on successful builds.  There can be 
warnings about long lines etc.
   + By default, patentsview is on r-universe https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/patentsview
   + Someone really smart should write a python library for the API!
<br />
<br />  
    
* Questions:
   + Is there a way to set up notifications on r-universe build failures?  If you miss a
skip_on_cran(), tests could work in your repo (if you have your API key as a repo secret)
but the build will silently fail on r-universe.  Don't ask how I know that.

   + Why don't the vignettes show up on r-universe?  The articles link is grayed out.

      Ah, on the build it shows Build pkgdown site (ropensci only) was skipped

   + Should we add a row_limit or something?  We'd page our way and stop when the row_limit is met.  For someone wanting more than a 1000 rows but not necessarily all the rows, especially since
there isn't the 100,000 row limitation now.  The API's ```after``` is now exposed 
in search_pv() so users could do their own paging. See the new [paging vignette](result-set-paging.html)
