Oh, the interesting things you'll learn when you take the time to read the API documentation!
Here are gems gleaned from a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/PatentsView/PatentsView-Code-Snippets/blob/master/07_PatentSearch_API_demo/PV%20PatentSearch%20API%20tutorial.ipynb) in PatentsView's PatentsView-Code-Snippets
repo.

## Fields Shorthand
The notebook starts out fairly fluffy but things really get interesting really quickly.
See this under "constructing your query",  I don't remember seeing this anywhere else:

> Some endpoints contain groups of fields representing related entities connected to one of that
> endpoint's primary entity type; for example, the patent endpoint contains a field "inventors",
> which contains information on all inventors associated with any given patent. *The fields for
> related entities can be requested in the API request's fields parameter as a group by using the
> group name in the fields parameter*, or individually by specifying the required field as "{entity_type}.{subfield}".

Mind blown, so we can, for example, request all the nested application fields from the patent endpoint by simply requesting "application" in the fields list.  

The new version of the R package will let its users leverage this same "feature".  (Purists will probably frown upon using it, as they 
would with a select * in SQL.  It can be helpful to see exactly what fields the API can return, should the documentation
be lagging.)


``` r
library(patentsview)

pat_res <- search_pv(qry_funs$eq(patent_id = "10568228"), fields=c("application"), method="POST")
pat_res$data$patent$application
#> [[1]]
#>   application_id application_type filing_date series_code rule_47_flag
#> 1      15/995745               15  2018-06-01          15        FALSE
#>   filing_type
#> 1          15
pat_res$request
#> #### An HTTP request where:
#> 
#> Method: POST
#> URL: https://search.patentsview.org/api/v1/patent/
#> Body: {"q":{"_eq":{"patent_id":"10568228"}},"f":["application"],"o":{"size":1000}}
```

The results should be the same if we used ```fields=get_fields("patent", groups=c("application"))```.  The difference
is that in the case above, it's the API deciding what fields to return while in the get_fields() case, we parsed
the [API's OpenAPI object](https://search.patentsview.org/static/openapi.json) when building the R package to determine what fields can be requested.  The results 
could be different if the API's actual return is not in sync with the API's OpenAPI object.  Here we see that
the requests are different but the results are the same (we used POSTs so the requests are easier to read since they don't need to be urlencoded):


``` r
app_fields <- get_fields("patent", groups=c("application"))
app_fields
#> [1] "application.application_id"   "application.application_type"
#> [3] "application.filing_date"      "application.filing_type"     
#> [5] "application.rule_47_flag"     "application.series_code"

pat_res <- search_pv(qry_funs$eq(patent_id = "10568228"), fields=app_fields, method="POST")
pat_res$data$patent$application
#> [[1]]
#>   application_id application_type filing_date series_code rule_47_flag
#> 1      15/995745               15  2018-06-01          15        FALSE
#>   filing_type
#> 1          15

# the request here and the one above differ, but the results were the same!
pat_res$request
#> #### An HTTP request where:
#> 
#> Method: POST
#> URL: https://search.patentsview.org/api/v1/patent/
#> Body: {"q":{"_eq":{"patent_id":"10568228"}},"f":["application.application_id","application.application_type","application.filing_date","application.filing_type","application.rule_47_flag","application.series_code"],"o":{"size":1000}}
```
## Unexpected Results

Then, as if that wasn't enough, some non-obvious behavior appears under the second bullet point
under the "Queries using related entity fields" header:

> When applying multiple conditions to related-entity fields, a central entity record will be 
> returned if any combination of its related entities satisfy those conditions.

In their example, they use George Washington as an inventor.  Humorously, there are modern
inventors with that name!  Abraham Lincoln is also used as an inventor.  Good ol' Abe is the only
US president to receive a [patent](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/external.html?db=USPAT&type=ids&q=(0006469).pn.) but
it's too early to be in the patentsview database and there are no modern Abraham Lincolns to be found
as inventors.

To demonstrate the API's not-exactly-intuitive behavior, we'll keep George as an inventor but substitute 
Thomas Jefferson for Abe, as there are inventors going by that famous name, though they aren't on nickels or
two dollar bills in the US.


``` r

# We got back all the inventors on the patents that met our search criteria.  We'll filter out

```

Now we'll hit the inventor endpoint with a similar query, as the jupyter notebook suggests.


``` r

inventors_query <- 
  with_qfuns(
    or(
      and(
        text_phrase(inventor_name_first = "George"),
        text_phrase(inventor_name_last = "Washington")
      ),
      and(
        text_phrase(inventor_name_first = "Thomas"),
        text_phrase(inventor_name_last = "Jefferson")
      )
    )
  )

inventor_fields <- c("inventor_id","inventor_name_first","inventor_name_last")
inventor_res <- search_pv(inventors_query, fields=inventor_fields, endpoint="inventor")
dl2 <- unnest_pv_data(inventor_res$data)

actual_inventors <-
   dl2$inventors %>%
   arrange(inventor_name_last, inventor_name_first)

actual_inventors
#>             inventor_id inventor_name_first inventor_name_last
#> 1  fl:th_ln:jefferson-1              Thomas          Jefferson
#> 2 fl:ge_ln:washington-4              George         Washington
#> 3 fl:ge_ln:washington-5      George Elliott         Washington
```

Now, with actual_inventors' inventor_ids in hand, we'll ask the patent endpoint for their patents.
The results are quite different than what the first query returned. (These patents would 
have names matching at least one of our two famous forefathers.  The first query non-intuitively
matched names where the first and last name matches did not necessarily both occur on the same inventor.)


``` r
id_query <- qry_funs$eq(inventors.inventor_id=actual_inventors$inventor_id)

# We need to pass fields since we're sorting (sort field has to be passed as a field)
# Without a sort we could rely on the default fields being returned if we liked

patent_fields <-c("patent_id", "inventors.inventor_name_first", "inventors.inventor_name_last")
pat_res <- search_pv(id_query, fields=patent_fields, sort=c("patent_id" = "asc"))

dl <- unnest_pv_data(pat_res$data)

# Also, the API's sort on patent_id, a string field, puts 10568228 first at the time of 
# this writing.  Would that be a bug or feature?  Below we'll apply our own sort
dl$patents[[1]][[1]]
#> [1] "10568228"

# we'll repeat the same filter we used on the first query's results
display_inventors <- 
   dl$inventors %>%
   filter(grepl("^(George|Thomas)", inventor_name_first ) | grepl("^(Washington|Jefferson)", inventor_name_last))  %>%
   arrange(nchar(patent_id), patent_id)  # string sort


display_inventors
#>    patent_id inventor_name_first inventor_name_last
#> 1    4078607              Thomas          Jefferson
#> 2    4104193              Thomas          Jefferson
#> 3    5643452              George         Washington
#> 4    5645778              George         Washington
#> 5    5736046              George         Washington
#> 6    5897817              George         Washington
#> 7    6218441              George         Washington
#> 8    6881337              George         Washington
#> 9    7144505              George         Washington
#> 10  10568228      George Elliott         Washington
```
## Worth Noting

It's not directly mentioned, but toward the top of the notebook, the publication/rel_app_text endpoint appears in the
special_keys hash. Its entity is a rel_app_text_publications.  There's a similar patent/rel_app_text
endpoint whose entity is rel_app_texts.  Generally, the entity is the plural form of the
singular endpoint, special_keys lists the exceptions to that rule, as the code shows.
