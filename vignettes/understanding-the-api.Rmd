Oh, the interesting things you'll learn when you take the time to read the API's documentation!
Here are two gems gleaned from a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/PatentsView/PatentsView-Code-Examples/blob/main/PatentSearch/0-patentsearch-api-demo.ipynb) in PatentsView's PatentsView-Code-Snippets
repo.

## Fields Shorthand
The notebook starts out fairly fluffy but things really get interesting really quickly.
See this under "constructing your query",  I don't remember seeing this anywhere else:

> Some endpoints contain groups of fields representing related entities connected to one of that
> endpoint's primary entity type; for example, the patent endpoint contains a field "inventors",
> which contains information on all inventors associated with any given patent. *The fields for
> related entities can be requested in the API request's fields parameter as a group by using the
> group name in the fields parameter*, or individually by specifying the required field as "{entity_type}.{subfield}".

Mind blown, so we can, for example, request all the nested application fields from the patent endpoint
by simply requesting "application" in the fields list.  

<a name="all-fields">
The new version of the R package will let its users leverage this same feature, allowing
group names to be specified in the fields parameter.  


``` r
library(patentsview)

query <- qry_funs$eq(patent_id = "10568228")
shorthand_results <- search_pv(query, fields = c("application"), method = "POST")

# Now that the R package uses httr2, we can use its last_request()
# to see what was POSTed to the API
cat(httr2::last_request()$body$data)
#> {"q":{"_eq":{"patent_id":"10568228"}},"f":["application","patent_id"],"s":[],"o":{"size":1000}}

# Here we view the results
shorthand_results$data$patent$application
#> [[1]]
#>   application_id application_type filing_date series_code rule_47_flag
#> 1      15/995745               15  2018-06-01          15        FALSE
#>   filing_type
#> 1          15

# Now we'll try to explicitly request all the application fields and make a POST to the API
explicit_fields <- get_fields("patent", groups = "application")
explicit_fields
#> [1] "application.application_id"   "application.application_type"
#> [3] "application.filing_date"      "application.filing_type"     
#> [5] "application.rule_47_flag"     "application.series_code"
explicit_results <- search_pv(query, fields = explicit_fields, method = "POST")

# but the R package figured out that the shorthand could be used instead
# so what was POSTed to the API is the same!
cat(httr2::last_request()$body$data)
#> {"q":{"_eq":{"patent_id":"10568228"}},"f":["application","patent_id"],"s":[],"o":{"size":1000}}

# but the results from the API are the same
explicit_results$data$patent$application
#> [[1]]
#>   application_id application_type filing_date series_code rule_47_flag
#> 1      15/995745               15  2018-06-01          15        FALSE
#>   filing_type
#> 1          15

# (Observation reported to the API team: application_type, series_code and filing_type
# all seem to have the same values and not just in this one example.)

```
The motivation to adopt the API's shorthand is that, with a modest query, explicitly requesting all of the
patent endpoint's fields can be too much to send via a GET request (the resulting URL can exceed 4K). 


## Unexpected Results

Then, as if that wasn't enough, some non-obvious behavior appears under the second bullet point
under the "Queries using related entity fields" header:

> When applying multiple conditions to related-entity fields, a central entity record will be 
> returned if any combination of its related entities satisfy those conditions.

In their example, they use George Washington as an inventor.  Humorously, there are modern
inventors with that name!  Abraham Lincoln is also used as an inventor.  Good ol' Abe is the only
US president so far to receive a [patent](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/external.html?db=USPAT&type=ids&q=(0006469).pn.) but
it's too early to be in the patentsview database and there are no modern Abraham Lincolns to be found
as inventors.

To demonstrate the API's not-exactly-intuitive behavior, we'll keep George as an inventor but substitute 
Thomas Jefferson for Abe, as there are inventors going by that famous name, though they aren't on nickels or
two dollar bills in the US.


``` r
library(dplyr)

patents_query <-

    or(
      and(

        text_phrase(inventors.inventor_name_last = "Jefferson")

patent_fields <-c("patent_id", "inventors.inventor_name_first", "inventors.inventor_name_last")
pat_res <- search_pv(patents_query, fields=patent_fields, endpoint="patent")
dl <- unnest_pv_data(pat_res$data)

# We got back all the inventors on the patents that met our search criteria.  We'll filter out
# the inventors that didn't strictly meet our criteria (they're coinventors that came along for 
# the ride with the ones that met our criteria), we want the noted behavior to be clear.

display_inventors <- 
   dl$inventors %>%
   filter(grepl("^(George|Thomas)", inventor_name_first ) | grepl("^(Washington|Jefferson)", inventor_name_last))

#> 31   6905071             Matthew          Jefferson
```
Some rows act as you'd expect, like patent 4078607's Thomas Jefferson.  In others, two inventors
combine to meet the search cititeria, like 6905071's
 **Thomas** Amundsen and Matthew **Jefferson**.  This might be a match we didn't intend.

Now we'll hit the inventor endpoint with a similar query, as the jupyter notebook suggests.


``` r

inventors_query <- 
  with_qfuns(
    or(
      and(
        text_phrase(inventor_name_first = "George"),
        text_phrase(inventor_name_last = "Washington")
      ),
      and(
        text_phrase(inventor_name_first = "Thomas"),
        text_phrase(inventor_name_last = "Jefferson")
      )
    )
  )

inventor_fields <- c("inventor_id","inventor_name_first","inventor_name_last")
inventor_res <- search_pv(inventors_query, fields=inventor_fields, endpoint="inventor")
actual_inventors <- unnest_pv_data(inventor_res$data)

actual_inventors[[1]]
#>             inventor_id inventor_name_first inventor_name_last
#> 1 fl:ge_ln:washington-4              George         Washington
#> 2 fl:ge_ln:washington-5      George Elliott         Washington
#> 3  fl:th_ln:jefferson-1              Thomas          Jefferson
```

Now, with actual_inventors' inventor_ids in hand, we'll ask the patent endpoint for their patents.
The results are quite different than what the first query returned. (These patents would 
have names matching at least one of our two famous forefather's names.  The first query non-intuitively
matched names where the first and last name matches did not necessarily both occur on the same inventor.)


``` r
id_query <- qry_funs$eq(inventors.inventor_id=actual_inventors$inventors$inventor_id)

patent_fields <-c("patent_id", "inventors.inventor_name_first", "inventors.inventor_name_last",
  "inventors.inventor_id")
pat_res <- search_pv(id_query, fields=patent_fields, sort=c(patent_id = "asc"))

dl <- unnest_pv_data(pat_res$data)

# we'll repeat the same name filter we used on the first query's results
display_inventors <- 
   dl$inventors %>%
   filter(grepl("^(George|Thomas)", inventor_name_first ) | grepl("^(Washington|Jefferson)", inventor_name_last)) %>%
   mutate(inventor = sub(".*/([^/]+)/$", "\\1", inventor)) # extract id from HATEOAS link

# sample pre-mutate value, note that we requested inventor_id but the API sent back `inventor`
dl$inventors$inventor[[1]]
#> [1] "https://search.patentsview.org/api/v1/inventor/fl:wa_ln:carter-1/"

display_inventors
#>    patent_id              inventor inventor_name_first inventor_name_last

## Acknowledgment

Again, credit goes to the Patentsview API team for creating the cited jupyter notebook.  This is just portions of it
in R package form.  The repo doesn't have a stated license but when I checked, I was told:

> For the repo license we are looking at the [GNU General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html) (GPL3).

That is the same license as R itself so I don't think we've violated anything.  For extra fun check
out [Russ' fork](https://github.com/mustberuss/PatentsView-Code-Snippets/blob/master/07_PatentSearch_API_demo/PV%20PatentSearch%20API%20tutorial.ipynb)
where there's python code for retrieving Mr. Jefferson's patents etc.  There was no reply when we asked if 
they'd be receptive to a PR.
